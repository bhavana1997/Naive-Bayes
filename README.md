# Naive-Bayes


1)Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.
2)It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
3)Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.
4)It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object. Some popular examples of Naïve Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles.


The formula for Bayes' theorem is given as:

P(A|B) is Posterior probability:
                            Probability of hypothesis A on the observed event B.
P(B|A) is Likelihood probability:
                            Probability of the evidence given that the probability of a hypothesis is true.
P(A) is Prior Probability:
                            Probability of hypothesis before observing the evidence.
P(B) is Marginal Probability:
                            Probability of Evidence.
